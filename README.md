dec_to_hex.java 
This file changes a decimal value to hexadecimal value. 

Dog.java
This file is demonstrating the use of invoking constructors. 

CalculateTotal.java
This file calculates the total from values added to an ArrayList. 
- clearing an ArrayList 
- modifying an entry
- removing an entry
- getting the size of the ArrayList 
- for loop to order the ArrayList into ascending order.
- User input to enter element into ArrayList. 

Car.java 
This file practices invoking constructors. 

hex_to_dec.java
This file takes a hexadecimal value entered by a user and prints out the decimal value of that value. 

Lottery.java
This file demonstrates the use of the java function Arrays.toString(). It is the simplest way to print an array as a string in Java. We demonstrate this with a predefined array and a user input array. 

LuckyFive.java
Thsi file uses the built in function Random() to generate a random number and if it does not match a specific value it will generate another random number inside a while loop.

Noodle.java
This file is demonstrating inheritance and Polymorphism. Inheritance saves us redefining the same class members all over again. Polymorphism allows a child class to share the information and behavior of its parent class while also incorporating its own functionality.
Parent class, superclass, and base class refer to the class that another class inherits from (like Shape).
Child class, subclass, and derived class refer to a class that inherits from another class (like Triangle). 
I have demonstrated:
- Inheritance
- Parent Class Aspect Modifiers
- Polymorphism 
- Method Overriding
- Using a Child Class as its Parent Class
- Child Classes in Arrays and ArrayLists. 
- Child Classes in Method Parameters
This is our parent class which calls the following child classes:
- Spaghetti.java
- Ramen.java
- Spaetzle.java
- Dinner.java 
- Pho.java 
- NoodleRestaurant.java 

Order.java
This file demonstrates conditions and control flow. Issue compiling this on my PC's cmd. 

Reservation.java
This file is invoking constructors with parameters and using if checks to return a print statement depending on the argument passed. 

SavingsAccount.java
This file demonstrates the use of methods. Methods can take input, do something with it, and return the kind of output we want. Procedural abstraction: knowing what a method does, but not how it accomplishes it.

Store.java
This file demonstrates the use of methods and parameters. 

ToDos.java
This file demonstrates different String manipulation functions. A String, which is widely used in Java, is an object that represents a sequence of characters. It is a great way to store information.
Functions used:
- length()
- concat()
- equals()
- indexOf()
- charAt()
- substring()
- toUpperCase() / toLowerCase()
